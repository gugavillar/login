## My process

To create this login screen i used HTML5 and CSS3 and follow the figma layout. I had to download some fonts in the google fonts and download some svg images for use in the project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project i was learn how to use flex container in css and how to make a screen of login

```css
aside.img,
section.content {
  height: 100vh;
  width: 50%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

div.form-action {
  display: flex;
  flex: 1 0 auto;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Useful resources
